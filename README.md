# LogMyMotion
## Background:
This was a project developed for UCSB's 2018-2019 CS/CE Capstone. I, along with 4 other computer science students, had 6 months to develop an mvp (minimum viable product) that we would later present at a computer science summit to professors and other students. To guide us along the way, we were partnered up with software engineers from LogMeIn, who gave us great advice and feedback as we developed our application.

## About the project:
As a team, we had decided to create a virtual personal trainer that would analyze your workout form and provide visual and audible feedback in real time. To achieve this, we researched various different technologies and tools but ultimately decided to use:
- ReactJS
- Node.js
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Tensorflow.js
- Firebase
- Google Cloud Text-to-Speech

## Presentation & Outcome:
We presented this project in March 2019 in front of  ~150 students and professors and ultimately ended up getting third place (out of 10 teams). You can see our presentation at the following link:
